Space Engineers inspires creativity and engineering with the motto, "Unleash your need to create" (Keen, 2024). This philosophy drives the game's immersive world, where players construct complex structures, vehicles, and systems in space. The BlockWorks application supports this creativity by helping players organise and manage the blocks and components needed for their builds. It simplifies resource management, allowing users to focus on creative and engineering challenges.

BlockWorks is a Python application designed to manage and track blocks and their associated components. The system provides a robust, user-friendly interface for creating, managing and organising block data. It enables users to perform essential operations such as adding new blocks and searching through existing blocks.
